\section{Proving Optimality}

Given a maximization linear program, it is easy to show that the optimal objective value has a certain lower bound by providing a feasible solution that achieves the value. However, this is not sufficient for proving the upper bound of the given linear program. A single feasible solution is not enough because the optimal solution is the maximum over all feasible solutions.
