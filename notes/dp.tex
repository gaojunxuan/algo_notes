\textbf{Dynamic programming} is a method for solving complex problem by breaking it down to a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing the solution, the algorithm can just use the previously computed solution. Each subproblem is indexed in some way to facilitate the lookup. The technique of storing solutions to subproblems is called \textbf{memoization}.
