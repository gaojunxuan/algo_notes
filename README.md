# Notes on Algorithm Design and Analysis

These notes cover topics commonly taught in an undergraduate introductory algorithm courses. They are loosely based on the lectures from CSC373 at the University of Toronto. I also consulted various sources when making those notes. See more in the bibliography section of the notes.

## Topics Covered

The notes cover the following topics:

- Divide and conquer
- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Network flow
- Problem complexity and computability
- Linear programming
- Approximation algorithms
- Randomized algorithms

To understand the materials, one should be familiar with elementary data structures, basic graph theory, complexity and correctness proof of recursive and iterative algorithms.

You are welcome to check out my notes on data structures and their analyses. I may occasionally refer to the data structure notes in these notes as well.

## Accuracy

I will try my best to ensure the accuracy of the contents. However, unlike my previous notes on data structure and theory of computation, these notes contain some personal opinions and interpretations that could be inaccurate or outright erroneous. If you find any errors, please let me know.

There are a lot of proofs in the notes. For most of them, the proof that I presented is not the only valid proof. There could be multiple valid ways to prove the same thing. But if you do believe that I made an error in one of the proofs, let me know too.

## Using these notes

Feel free to use these notes as reference, but if you are taking CSC373 or any other algorithm courses at other universities, I still highly recommend that you keep your own notes. These notes should be a companion of your notes, not a substitute.

## Contribute

These notes are still very much a work in progress. I aim to finish them by the summer of 2022. Any contribution is appreciated. If you want to contribute: edit, improve, or add new contents, feel free to chime in at any time. Please make sure to cite your sources as necessary.
